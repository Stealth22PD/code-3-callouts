            <summary>
            This function will be called directly by VocalDispatch.
            It then calls the function you specify in SetupVocalDispatchAPI.
            The function you specify has no knowledge of VocalDispatch and can therefore exist safely in your code.
            This function cannot exist safely in other classes and must be hidden away here, instead, to provide a safe middleman between VocalDispatch and your code.
