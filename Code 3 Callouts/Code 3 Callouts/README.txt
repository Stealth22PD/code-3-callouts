-------------------------
Requirements
-------------------------
You must have version 0.39 (or later) of the RAGE Plugin Hook installed.

You must have a fully legal, non-pirated version of GTA V.

Please note that the Stealth.Common.dll has been updated, and copies of this DLL from previous versions are NOT compatible!

The version of Stealth.Common.dll included with this package is v1.6.0.1

Code 3 Callouts WILL check for the correct RPH and Stealth.Common versions, and it will refuse to run if the correct versions are not installed.

-------------------------
Automatic Installation
-------------------------
- Run "Code 3 Callouts.msi" to install the plugin

- The installer package requires Administrator rights to run

- The setup package will attempt to detect your Grand Theft Auto installation path using the registry. If the install path is not found, your copy of GTA V has not been properly installed

-------------------------
Manual Installation
-------------------------
- Copy the Stealth.Common.dll file into your main/ROOT GTA V directory (typically C:\Program Files\Rockstar Games\Grand Theft Auto V). These files should be in the same folder as GTAV.exe and RagePluginHook.exe

- Copy the Code 3 Callouts.dll and Code 3 Callouts.ini files into the "Grand Theft Auto V\Plugins\LSPDFR" directory.

- Copy the "Code 3 Audio" folder into the "Grand Theft Auto V\LSPDFR\Police Scanner" folder.

- DO NOT attempt to load this plugin via the RAGE console. LSPDFR will load the callouts automatically.

-------------------------
Usage
-------------------------
After the plugin is installed, there is no need to do anything. LSPDFR will load the callouts automatically.
