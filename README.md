# Code 3 Callouts
Code 3 Callouts is my callout pack for LSPDFR.

I have decided to open-source all of my LSPDFR projects, as they have not been touched in a long time. Most of them probably don't work that well anymore, and I simply don't have the time to develop or maintain them any longer.

The code is old, and was written when I was still new to LSPDFR/GTA programming. It could probably use some refactoring, but again, I have no time to do any of that. Feel free to submit a pull request with any suggested improvements, and I will look at the PR's as time allows.

If there is enough activity on trying to move the project forward, I can explore doing releases in the future, and crediting any contributors.

Feel free to use this repo as a resource to learn from and improve your programming skills. Crediting me for any code you use is appreciated, but please be aware that this project is licensed under the [GNU GPLv3](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/gpl-3.0/). If you fork the project or use any portion of the code, it basically has to be released under the same open source license. To that end, feel free to fork the project and continue carrying the torch, but please respect the open source license. :)

This goes without saying, but this code is provided with no warranty, and I accept no liability for anything. :p

Enjoy!
